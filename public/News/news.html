<b><u><font size="3">Falcons beat Bury to take the 2016 Northern League Title</b></u><br><P>
<font size="3">It's taken 20 years but The Falcons finally took the Northern League Div. One Title. 
<p>
<i><b>Summed up nicely in a Facebook posting from George Swanson:-</b></i><br><p>

It has been a privilege following the Falcons for the last 4 years and witnessing them lift:-<ul>
<li><B>2014 - The Northern KO Cup 
<li>2014 - Division 2 Winners
<li>2015 - Division 2 Winners
<li>2014 - British Under 13 Champion - Kieran Swanson.
<li>2015 - British Veteran Champion  - Lee Lawrence.
<li>2016 - The Northern League Division 1 title .</li>
</ul>

</b>The spirit and will to win by the team this year is unmatched in any sport I have been involved in. Having to contend with the loss of heat leader Jason Burke early season , major injuries to Lee Lawrence and Neil Swanson which curtailed their involvement and the limited appearances of Polish star Daniel Ordon , each and every rider rose to the challenge and covered their missing teammates. It was a real squad victory! Maybe one day they will receive the recognition they deserve .<br><P>
